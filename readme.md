# About the app

- This is a `monolitic express app`  
- A very light weight todo app that follows the restful routes pattern 

# Setup Instructions

- Paste the following into your terminal - `git clone git@github.com:samking02/backend-test.git`
    - If that gives you an error then you need to [setup SSH](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/) or use the HTTPS link instead: `git clone https://github.com/samking02/backend-test.git` *(this requires use of your github credentials, the password will be hidden while typing)*
- Now `cd` into `backend-test` and run `npm install`
- Start your mongo daemon `mongod` in a separate terminal tab
- Run your application in its own terminal tab
- Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser
